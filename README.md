# Systems of attached spring-mass oscillators
Project by Eric Chen, Sophie Cao, Xue Er Ding, Jing Han Sun, and Qiu Shi Wang

# Description

The code numerically solves the equations of motion for a system of N attached spring-mass oscillators using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp, a numerical initial value problem solver in the SciPy library.

It allows us to visualize how when all the springs and masses are identical and N goes to infinity, the system obeys the wave equation. It also allows us to test how the system deviates from the wave equation when the spring constants or masses are nonconstant.
